  "description": "Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.\n\nA target that is held shut by a mundane lock ar that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.\n\nIf you choose a target that is held shut with *[arcane lock](../arcane-lock/ \"arcane lock (lvl 2)\")*, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.",
